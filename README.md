Linux workstation management services

This is a project to develop a comprehensive set of tools useful for managing a set of Linux-based workstations, and which are focused on the challenges of dynamic workstation environments, audit facilities, and pre-emptive monitoring of systems for software/hardware issues, potential security breaches, etc.

At this time the toolset is incredibly immature and probably should not be used in production unless you hate yourself and everyone around you.
